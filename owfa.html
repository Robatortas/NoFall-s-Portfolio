                    Other Words for Alone is a 2 year long project meant to hone my
                    skills as a programmer.
                    In the latest alpha versions of the game made with our own inhouse game engine made entirely in Java without the use of
                    any external libraries. we implemented perlin noise-based terrain generation, physics, collision,
                    inventory system, player movement, stamina, health and other interactuable items and entities.
